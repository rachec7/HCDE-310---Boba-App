# HCDE-310-Boba-App

This is a final project for HCDE310 Interactive Systems Design And Technology.

This project is a boba drink generator app that runs using two APIs: 
- Text to Emotion (https://promptapi.com/marketplace/description/text_to_emotion-api)
- Documenu (https://documenu.com/)

A user will enter 3-4 sentences on how they were feeling yesterday and today, as well as 
select one boba shop out of the ones in the list (if they are currently at a boba shop and 
having difficulty deciding on a drink, they can select the name of the one they are currently at).
Once they press submit, the app will run, and a drink suggestion will be given to them.
The drink suggestion will include:
- Drink name
- Drink description (if the menu included a description for the drink)
- Drink price
- Image of the drink


Feel free to try out our app here to get a drink suggestion!
